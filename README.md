* To achieve this goal, follow an agile methodology, specifically the SCRUM framework. The first step will be to gather the requirements and define the scope of the project. This will involve meeting with stakeholders, including the coffee shop owner, the marketing team, and the sales team, to understand their needs and expectations. From this meeting, create a list of user stories that will guide the project.
* The next step is to start the project by creating a backlog of tasks to be completed. And gather requirements such as BRD to outline the business needs and objectives for analyzing the coffee shop's business development for new products.
* This will include data gathering, cleaning, and processing, as well as developing SQL queries to explore the data.
* After analyzing the data, I will develop a plan to improve the new product based on customer habits and profiles. This will involve developing marketing and sales strategies that target specific customer segments based on gender, loyalty, and age range. I will create acceptance criteria to ensure that the strategies are effective and aligned with the stakeholders' expectations.
* Once the plan is developed, I will execute the project by working with the marketing and sales teams to implement the strategies. I will monitor the progress of the project and make adjustments as needed to ensure that the goals are being metAnalyze Coffee Shop's business development, especially for new products, and how to improve the new products. The data is processed using SQL queries to explore the data, and using Tableau for visualization.
* There are many ways to perform EDA, one of which is by conducting Univariate, BI variate, and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, it is sharpened by sales analysis to    create a Product Drill Down visualization which aims to find out which products have good sales performance, whenever the product is purchased a lot, which product categories are sold the most, and at which outlets are the best sales.
* Customer habits and customer profiles are important factors in determining the improvement strategy for sales. In this section, we look at the gender, loyalty, and age range of customers who are more likely to try new products. Monitoring customer behavior to find out when we should recommend new products and to what kind of customers for product offerings.
